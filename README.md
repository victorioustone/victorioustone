### Hi, I'm Victoria 👋🏻 

I'm a System Analyst 🛠️   
However, I get the best of both worlds – I'm interested in Data Science 📊        

I got a CS degree 🎓, and [here is my graduate work (in Russian)](https://github.com/victorioustone/cityfarming), where I analyse the cross-influence of microclimate, lighting, and soil parameters in the vertical farm of the “Fundamentals of Biotechnology” of the Russian Academy of Sciences.      

The results were also published in "Agronomy" journal (MDPI) 📃 -> [here (in English)](https://doi.org/10.3390/agronomy13082174)    

✍🏻 Skills     
**Supervised Learning**: CatBoost, XGBoost, Random Forest, SVM           
**Unsupervised Learning**: K-means Clustering             
**Deep Learning**: CNN (pytorch)         
**Data Visualization**: seaborn (matplotlib), plotly         

🛠️ Tools     
**Language**: Javascript (Node JS), Python, SQL    
**Database**: MySQL, PostgreSQL
